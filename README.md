# X.F Page in Android AlertDialog
Simple example that demonstates how Xamarin.Forms page may be wrapped in Android AlertDialog. 

Billion thanks to **Artur Drobinskiy** who created XamarinFormsExtensions CreateView method. I found his implementation here http://www.arturdr.ru/android/xamarin-forms-i-slozhnosti-integratsii-v-android-prilozheniya/ and made some minor changes, so please refer to his blog for extension code updates.

That is how it looks like:

1. Application main page:
![Main page](/Screenshots/1.png)

2. Second page in cross-platfrom navigation stack (just to show that I am not cheating :)):
![Second page 1](/Screenshots/2.png)

3. Android AlertDialog with fullscreen cross-platform page:

4. Android AlertDialog with custom sizes cross-platform page:
